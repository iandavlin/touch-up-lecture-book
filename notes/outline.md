# Understanding What You're Actually Looking At

---

## 1. Philosophy of Touch-Up

### 1.1 When Not to Touch Up
- [Market value risk](#img-market-value-risk)
- Reputation risk  
- Customer expectations misaligned with realistic outcomes  
- Incomplete knowledge of the original finish schedule  
- Highly complex or layered finish systems with unknown variables  
- Insufficient reversibility  
- Active instability (checking, lifting, progressing adhesion failure)  
- Contamination or unknown prior repair materials  

### 1.2 When to Touch Up
- Exposed wood requiring protection  
- Fresh damage on a newer instrument with high match confidence  
- Financially viable scope (time, risk, outcome aligned with compensation)  
- Previous unoriginal repair that can be improved  
- Preventative intervention to stop further finish failure  

### 1.3 General Philosophy of Finish Repair
- Do not enlarge the defect  
- Preserve reversibility whenever possible  
- Identify or deduce the original finish schedule before intervening  
- Let the schedule guide the repair  

**Case Study — Post-repair work at Breedlove**  
Observation: Proper pore filling simplifies finish repair compared to surface painting.

**The theoretically perfect repair:**
- Replicates original materials  
- Replicates original layer order  
- Replicates original film thickness  
- Replicates original UV exposure and aging state  

## 1.3.1 Strategies for Schedule Decuction 
- Finish chips maginfing glass
- Looking at the wood where the finish has flaked off
- Solvent tests
- Factory Records 
- Finishing logic - how would you apply it to get the same look in the fewest steps ? 

### 1.4 Avoiding the Shame Pit
- Test off the project  
- No free work  
- Stay within defined scope  
- Define the stopping point before beginning  
- Never fix two variables at once  
- Document formulas and stages  
- Remove mechanically with restraint  
- Allow lacquer to cure before leveling  
- Do not redo without a better test plan  
- If lighting changes, stop judging color  
- Do not work emotionally  
- If you caused damage, stop and inform the client

## 2. Light Theory

### 2.1 The Fundamental Rule
- White light contains multiple wavelengths  
- Materials absorb some wavelengths and return others  
- The color observed is the light that is not absorbed 
- High CRI bulb, normal bulb and warm bulb demo
  - Talk about accuracy of light in touch ups


This produces three perceptual variables:

- **Hue** — Which wavelengths survive absorption  
- **Value** — How much total light returns to the eye  
- **Chroma** — How selectively wavelengths survive

### 2.2 OKLCH Demonstration — Red Progression

#### Base Red (Reference)
[oklch(0.55 0.20 25)](https://oklch.com/#0.55,0.20,25)

---

#### Chroma Reduction (Lightness Constant)

Lightness = 0.55  
Hue = 25  

- Slightly muted  
  [oklch(0.55 0.12 25)](https://oklch.com/#0.55,0.12,25)

- More muted  
  [oklch(0.55 0.06 25)](https://oklch.com/#0.55,0.06,25)

- Very low chroma  
  [oklch(0.55 0.02 25)](https://oklch.com/#0.55,0.02,25)

Observe:
- Lightness remains constant  
- Hue remains red  
- Only chroma collapses  

---

#### Value Shift (Chroma Constant)

Chroma = 0.20  
Hue = 25  

- Higher value (pink direction)  
  [oklch(0.70 0.20 25)](https://oklch.com/#0.70,0.20,25)

- Lower value (dark red)  
  [oklch(0.40 0.20 25)](https://oklch.com/#0.40,0.20,25)

Observe:
- Chroma remains constant  
- Hue remains constant  
- Only lightness changes

### 2.3 How Light Porperties Changes Color Perception 
- Specular reflection  
- Diffuse reflection  
- Refraction and Refraction Index 
  - (mismatch wood demo) 
- Absorption 
- Reflection - Color   
- Scatter 
- Diffusion

## 3. Light in a Guitar Finish — The Layered Optical System (Wood → Air)

### 3.2 Wood — The Optical Substrate
- Fiber orientation (anisotropy)  
- Subsurface scatter within cell structure  
- Chatoyance (directional reflectivity)  
- Natural absorption within lignin and cellulose  
- Wetting and depth increase 
- Dye before sealer. 
- Temporal Considerations. 
  - wood uv 
  - dye before sealer

### 3.3 Pore Structure and Filler - Open Pore Wood
- Sealer before pore filler - pore filler before sealer - how to detect. very important
- Index change when pores are filled  
- Pigmented filler vs Dye Filler
- Temporal Considrations
 - Binder Yellows 
 - pores duller 
 - 
### 3.4 Sealer Layer
- Substrate isolation  
- Refractive transition between wood and film how - RI affects look
- Control of absorption stacking  
- Contribution to perceived depth  
- Hand rubbed vs Shot sealer
- Adhesion issues at sealer layer - shinies 

### 3.5 Color Layers 
- Toner (dye) in clear (path-length stacking)  
- Pigment systems (absorption + scatter)  
- Complementary shifts and neutralization  
- Temporal Considerations 
  - dye
  - pigment

### 3.6 Clear Coat
- Refraction at film boundary  
- Film thickness and path-length increase  
- Darkening with build  
- Angle-dependent value shift  
- Temporal Considerations 
 - Yellowed lacquer can throw off your color sense. 
  - A yellow guitar may be a white guitar with ambered clear coat. 
 - Ambered lacquer is not the same as lacquer with dye. 
 - Finish checking
 - Diffusion due to old lacquer forumlas. 
 - Finish checking 

### 3.7 Surface Geometry (Film → Air Interface)
- Specular reflection at the final boundary  
- Diffuse reflection from micro-texture  
- Sheen and highlight geometry  
- Micro-scratches and hardness  
- Contrast and perceived depth  

### 3.8 Finish Schedule Deduction 
- Examine finish chips if available
 - color in the chip will indiacate toner coat
- Examing exposed substrate if available 
  - dye in wood may be apparant   QQ  1` b vgftr54e3
  - pore filler
