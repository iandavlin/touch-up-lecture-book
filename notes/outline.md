# Understanding What You're Actually Looking At

## 1. Philosophy of Touch-Up
### 1.1 When Not to Touch Up
- Market value risk  
- Reputation risk  
- Customer expectations misaligned with realistic outcomes  
- Incomplete knowledge of the original finish schedule  
- Highly complex or layered finish systems with unknown variables  
- Insufficient reversibility  
- Active instability (checking, lifting, adhesion failure progressing)  
- Contamination or unknown prior repair materials  
### 1.2 When to Touch Up
- A repair involves material replacement (do not leave exposed wood)
- Fresh damage on a newer instrument with high match confidence
- Financially viable project (time, risk, and outcome aligned with compensation)
- Previous unoriginal repair attempt that can be improved
- Preventative intervention will stop further finish failure
### 1.3 General Philosophy of Finish Repair

- Do not enlarge the defect
- Preserve reversibility whenever possible
- Identify or deduce the original finish schedule before intervening
- Let the schedule guide the repair process

- Case study: Post-repair work at Breedlove
- Observation: Proper pore filling simplifies finish repair compared to surface painting

- The theoretically perfect repair:
  - Replicates original materials
  - Replicates original layer order
  - Replicates original film thickness
  - Replicates original UV exposure and aging state
### 1.4 Tips for Avoiding the Shame Pit
- Test. Test. Test. Off the project.
- No free work.
- If you commit to “make it better” work, stay within the defined scope.
- Define the stopping point before you begin.
- Never fix two variables at once.
- Write down formulas and steps before spraying.
- Photograph and document each stage before altering it.
- Always remove mechanically with the dedication of a paleontologist uncovering a fossil.
- Always wait for lacquer to cure sufficiently before removing it mechanically.
- Do not speculatively remove a decent repair unless you have a clear plan and a superior test board result.
- If lighting changes, stop judging color.
- Don't work angry.
- If you are touching up damage you just created, stop and call the customer.

## 2. Light in a Guitar Finish: The Layered Optical System (Wood → Air)

### 2.1 How Light Behaves
- Specular reflection (mirror-like return from a smooth surface)
- Diffuse reflection (scattered return from rough surfaces)
- Refraction (bending as light crosses material boundaries)
- Absorption (removal of specific wavelengths)
- Scatter (internal redirection within a material)

---

### 2.2 The Fundamental Rule
- White light contains multiple wavelengths
- Materials absorb some wavelengths and reflect others
- The color you see is the light that is not absorbed
- Darkening = increased absorption
- Desaturation = broader absorption or increased scatter

---

### 2.3 Wood: The Optical Substrate
- Fiber orientation (anisotropy)
- Subsurface scatter within cell structure
- Chatoyance (directional reflectivity)
- Natural absorption within lignin and cellulose
- Oxidation and UV darkening (value shift over time)
- Why wetting increases depth

---

### 2.4 Pore Structure and Filler
- Micro-shadowing from open pores
- Index changes when pores are filled
- Pigmented filler and contrast control
- Scatter introduced by filler materials

---

### 2.5 Sealer Layer
- Isolating the substrate
- Refractive transition between wood and film
- Effect on absorption stacking
- Contribution to perceived depth

---

### 2.6 Color Layers (If Present)
- Dye in wood (selective absorption)
- Toner in clear (path-length stacking)
- Pigment systems (absorption + scatter)
- Complementary shifts and neutralization
- Chroma controlls

---

### 2.7 Clear Coat
- Refraction at film boundary
- Film thickness and path-length increase
- Darkening with build
- Angle-dependent value shift
- Ambering and UV shift over time

---

### 2.8 Surface Geometry (Film → Air Interface)
- Specular reflection at the final boundary
- Diffuse reflection from micro-texture
- Sheen and highlight geometry
- Micro-scratches and hardness
- Contrast and perceived depth

---

### 2.9 What the Eye Interprets
- Value (total light returned)
- Hue (dominant surviving wavelengths)
- Chroma (selectivity of filtering)
- Why angle and thickness alter perception
